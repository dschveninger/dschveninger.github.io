# Doug Schveninger GitHub Pages

I am using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) as a sample way to creating a quick static website about yourself and information that you have learned other information about yourself.

## Original sample markdown

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/dschveninger/dschveninger.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
