# Doug Schveninger GitHub Pages

## What is this site about

I am using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) as a sample way to creating a quick static website about yourself and information that you have learned and other information about yourself. 

I am doing this by using [GitHub Pages for my Alias](https://github.com/dschveninger/dschveninger.github.io) and including [My Markdown Information repo](https://github.com/dschveninger/dougschveninger) as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to share the data with GitHub Pages.

## TODO: review and add to the site

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
