# Doug Schveninger GitHub Pages

## What is this site about

I am using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)
as a sample way to creating a quick static website about yourself and information that you have
learned and other information about yourself.

I am doing this by using [GitHub Pages for my Alias](https://github.com/dschveninger/dschveninger.github.io) and including
[My Markdown Information repo](https://github.com/dschveninger/dougschveninger) as a
[git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to share the data with GitHub Pages.

[Information about Doug Schveninger](dougschveninger/about/introduction.md)

[todo page](TODO.md) of items that I would like to improve in the repos.
